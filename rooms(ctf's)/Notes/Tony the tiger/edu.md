- Serialisation at an abstract is the process of converting data - specifically "Objects" in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages such as Java into lower-level formatting known as "byte streams", where it can be stored for later use such as within files, databases, and/or traversed across a network. It is then later converted from this "byte stream" back into the higher-level "Object". This final conversion is known as "De-serialisation"

- "Objects" in a programming-context can be compared to real-life examples. Simply, an "Object" is just that - a thing. "Objects" can contain various types of information such as states or features. To correlate to a real-world example...Let's take a lamp.

- A lamp is a great "Object". a lamp can be on or off, the lamp can have different types of bulbs - but ultimately it is still a lamp. What type of bulb it uses and whether or not the lamp is "on" or "off"Â in this instance is all stored within an "Object".

- A "serialisation" attack is the injection and/or modification of data throughout the "byte stream" stage.
