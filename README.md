# Welcome


These are my try hackme note.

Some are pretty some are just the process of going through a room.

The [index for hacks](/indexForHacks) still needs a lot of work.  The idea is to locate a specific vulnerability, room, or service quickly.

Still trying to organize and upgrade notes to obsidian format.  

The newer formatted ones will be in rooms/notes.

I Don't play king of the hill (KOTH), so not much there. 

Ohh, I did have a un-mounting issue where I lost like a week of notes, if they are blank, well, 

Thank you for stopping by.
