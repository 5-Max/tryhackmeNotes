# Welcome


These started out as my try hackme notes that developed into more general cyber security, coding, and App Sec notes.

Some are pretty some are just the process of going through a room.

The [index for hacks](/indexForHacks) still needs a lot of work.  The idea is to locate a specific vulnerability, room, or service quickly.

Still trying to organize and upgrade notes to markdown format.  

The newer formatted ones will be in rooms/notes.

I Don't play king of the hill (KOTH), so not much there. 

Ohh, I did have a un-mounting issue where I lost one week of notes, if they are blank, well, 

Thank you for stopping by.
