These are my try hackme note.

Some are pretty some are just the process of going through a room.

The [[indexForHacks]] still needs a lot of work but the idea is to locate a specific vuln quickly or if someone ask for help I can find the notes quickly.  

The side notes are supposed to be initiall access then privesc. 

Still trying to organize and upgrade notes to obsidian format.  

The newer formated ones will be in rooms/notes.

Don't play king of the hill (KOTH), so not much there. 

Ohh, I did have a un-mounting issue where I lost like a week of notes, if they are blank, well, 

Thank you for stoping by.
